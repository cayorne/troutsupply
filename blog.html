    <p>hey
    <br>a quick shoutout to the people that bought a hat u da best
    <br>at some point im probably gonna make shirts or something but i still 
    <br>need to design them.
    <br>on another note, the WEBUYFISH number was actually a real number for a small
    <br>local library in fucking delaware LMFAO.
    <br>so uh if you still have that number, please do not call it.
        
        <br>
        thats all for now.
        <br>
        thanks.
        <br>

    <h2>3/30/2023</h2>
    <p>so a lot has happened this week
    <br>i have sold an absolutely stupid number of hats
    <br>i originally intended for this to be a joke, that maybe 2 or 3 people would
    <br>care about, but so far 12 fucking people have bought one.
    <br>naturally, this has given me ideas to release other troutsupply merch
    <br>but the way things work since im not going to hold a bunch of inventory
    <br>for this stupid bit (along with not wanting to charge everyone like 15 dollars for shipping)
    <br>there was a point where i actually almost overdrafted my checking account because 4 people
    <br>ordered one at the same time after i spent 700 bucks getting my car fixed
    <br><br>
    that was a fun conversation with my mom
    <br>
    <br>
    anyways, i think its awesome how many people want to buy and wear this stupid hat im selling
    <br>so as long as i can keep selling them at a profit, i'll try to keep the cost as low as possible
    <br>
    <br>
    i would also like to take this time to thank everyone who has been running troutsupply.net
    <br> as a tag in games, its actually brought a stupid amount of traffic to the site, and the fact
    <br> that i've moved enough volume to consitute status as a super niche underground apparel
    <br> brand is absolutely fucking hysterical
    <br>
    <br> on an unrelated note i watched some japanese bug fights last night, absolutely fucking wild
    <br>that you can put that shit on tv in japan.
    <br>
        <br>
        thats all for now.
        <br>
        thanks.
        <br> <br>
        p.s. you can now just type shop.troutsupply.net to access the store lole
    </p>

    <h2>3/16/2023</h2>
    <p>a few cool things happened this week.
        i met up with hud, which was fun.
        <br>
        i watched a movie called the banshees of inisherin. <br>
        it was a very profound movie full of symbolism about never ending wars
        including that  <br>for irish independence. <br>
        nobody even truly knows why they hate each other or why they're fighting
        but only two things are known for sure.
        <li>
            1. people are going to get hurt.
        </li>
        <li>2. it will never end. (until everyone is dead)</li>
        <br>
       also includes a very engaging character arc involving dealing with the loss of friendship  <br>
       in maybe the worst possible way.
       <br>
        anyways, im currently workshopping silly fish based team names for lan, <br> which has been entertaining <br>
        so far the leaders are <br> anchoviearsenal.net,  <br>bassnation.com,  <br>whalemarket.shop,  <br>and pikepalace.net
        <br>
        <br>
        now to work on the hate sites for my new competition....
        <br>
        <br>
        thats all for now.
        <br>
        thanks.
