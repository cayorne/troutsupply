    <h2>3/16/2023</h2>
    <p>a few cool things happened this week.
        i met up with hud, which was fun.
        <br>
        i watched a movie called the banshees of inisherin. <br>
        it was a very profound movie full of symbolism about never ending wars
        including that  <br>for irish independence. <br>
        nobody even truly knows why they hate each other or why they're fighting
        but only two things are known for sure.
        <li>
            1. people are going to get hurt.
        </li>
        <li>2. it will never end. (until everyone is dead)</li>
        <br>
       also includes a very engaging character arc involving dealing with the loss of friendship  <br>
       in maybe the worst possible way.
       <br>
        anyways, im currently workshopping silly fish based team names for lan, <br> which has been entertaining <br>
        so far the leaders are <br> anchoviearsenal.net,  <br>bassnation.com,  <br>whalemarket.shop,  <br>and pikepalace.net
        <br>
        <br>
        now to work on the hate sites for my new competition....
        <br>
        <br>
        thats all for now.
        <br>
        thanks.
